Our project

our project represents a digital library system where we can organize and check everything related to
the library. In our case we decided to use members that can borrow and return books and at the end, we ended up adding 
movies too. The system displayed here would be what an admin or a librarian would use since it has access to create
and delete not only members but media.

Class diagrams

In our class diagrams we can see a clear evolution since at the beginning, we where planning to only have books available.
Which at the end developed in not only books but movies too. We got rid of unnecessary classes and interfaces, like the class
person, which was our first attempt of inheritance.

Design Pattern

The design pattern that we decided to use is the singleton pattern. This decision was done to ensure that there is only 
one instance of the library system throughout the application.
